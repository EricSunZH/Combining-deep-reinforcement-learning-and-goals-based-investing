### Introduction

Goal-Based Investing (GBI) is an investment approach where performance is measured by the success of investments in meeting the investor's financial goals (e.g., retirement, education, or vacation home). The objective is to invest systematically in a consistent manner with the investorâ€™s risk profile and time horizon of the goals.</br></br>
Portfolio optimization for GBI can be viewed as an optimal control problem performed within a data-driven world. GBI can be solved via reinforcement learning (RL), a paradigm of learning by trial-and-error, solely from rewards or punishments. It was shown that RL can solve financial applications of intertemporal choice.</br></br>
Within deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, the RL agents construct and learn their knowledge through deep learning of neural networks. As pointed out by Arulkumaran (2017), implementing deep learning architectures with reinforcement learning algorithms is capable of scaling to previously unsolvable problems. That is because DRL can learn from raw sensors directly as input. Therefore, using DRL in investment management could be an efficient solution to the traditional portfolio management problem.</br></br>
This research aims to combine DRL and GBI by setting up an investment framework that transforms requests of clients into practical portfolio constructions and automated investment executions. Common problems in RL such as the selection of agents and dimension reduction of action space will also be addressed within the scope of GBI. </br></br>
