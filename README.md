### Introduction

Goal-Based Investing (GBI) is an investment approach where performance is measured by the success of investments
in meeting the investor financial goals (e.g., retirement, education, or vacation home). The objective is to invest
systematically in a consistent manner with investorâ€™s risk profile and time horizon of the goals.</Br></Br>
Portfolio optimization for GBI can be viewed as an optimal control problem performed within a data-driven
world. GBI can be solved via reinforcement learning (RL), a paradigm of learning by trial-and-error, solely from
rewards or punishments. It was shown that RL can solve financial applications of intertemporal choice.</Br></Br>
Within deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, the RL agents construct and learn their own knowledge
through deep learning of neural networks.</Br></Br>
